# BeatFinger

Trying to develop an engine-agnostic rhythm game in TDD, powered by [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [Phazer3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) (for now).

Motivations:

- Develop a simple but fun game, inspired by BeatSaber and GuitarHero
- Experiment TDD in a game development project
- Try to keep the main game logic engine-agnostic and stateless
- Give a test-drive to Deno, with a minimal amount of dependencies and tooling

## Usage

After installing [Deno 1.0](https://deno.land/#installation):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/adrienjoly/deno-beatfinger.git
$ cd deno-beatfinger
$ ./serve.sh # then open the URL in your web browser
```
